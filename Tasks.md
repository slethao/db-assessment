# Question 1
What type of animal is the youngest pet?
# Question 2
The doctor needs the registrations (uuids) as strings of all the pets between 3 and 4 years old. Can you help?
# Question 3
We need a `view` showing the number of pets we have for each type of animal.
# Question 4
To better schedule visits, can you list the pet names after the alphabetical order of the animal type?
# Question 5
What's the name of the oldest animal with less than 3 legs?
# Question 6
What's the ratio between male & female pets?
# Question 7
We want to have a party for all pets born in summer. Which pets would we celebrate at this event?
# Question 8
It seems like the column `tail` in `extremity` is rather useless. How would you change it to represent that an animal either has a tail or not?
# Question 8
We want to keep track of the medications & vaccines a pet has had or has scheduled. What table structure would you propose and why?
(This question is targeted at critical architectural thinking skills rather than SQL. Think ahead. What commonalities could appear? What kind of data-related questions could arise from such information?)
